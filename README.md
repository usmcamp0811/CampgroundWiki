# README

This is something I have been meaning to do for a long time but have never gotten around to doing. So I am always 
doing something on a computer and I try my best to keep notes on what I did to make stuff happen, but lets face it
that becomes a hot mess that is more of pain than an aide. SO I finally got off my but and have started this [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki).
It is by me and for me, but if it helps the passerby so be it.
